# Ideas for the Future Improvement

## Current New ideas

### Debug mode
At times, I encounter difficulties while dealing with robots including issues with their setup, functionality, and the data processing. It would be really helpful if a debug mode could be activated during the setup process that should send the input data from IFTTT to the output. This would help me to easily identify any issues and troubleshoot them effectively. Additionally, if the output data after the filter processing can be displayed, it would be a big help.
