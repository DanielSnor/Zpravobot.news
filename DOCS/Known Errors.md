### Fix-2024-06: Twitter replies and quotes
Replies and quotes from Twitter don't work. As they previously worked, DS probably caused it when the universal script was composed, and some functions weren't included in the Twitter branch. We have to compare the current script with the historical one. This fix has low priority as Twitter isn't currently used at Zpravobot.news.

### Fix-2024-07: Empty spaces in EntryContent
Sometimes post contains several or many empty spaces at the end of EntryContent followed by […]. Empty spaces could be also in front of the URL.
example: https://zpravobot.news/@Pocketlint/111855317689168502

### Fix-2024-08: Text post only also contains URL to original post
If post contains only simple text without any URL or added picture, it doesn't make sense to show there also link to the original post. User can comment it in original location when will use way Avatar-link to original profile-post.
(pokud zpracovavany post neobsahuje URL ani link na obrazek, URL na originalni post se nezobrazi podobne jako v pripade, kdy post obsahuje URL)

## Already solved errors

### Fix-2024-05: isCommercialInPost()
Function isCommercialInPost() works fine for Nitter, but not for RSS. Need to rewrite.
(musíme to vymyslet jinak - možná getContent a změna proměnné?!, potom isCommerciaInPost?)
