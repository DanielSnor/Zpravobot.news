**Zprávobot.news** 📰🤖 (Newsbot.news in Czech) is run by Daniel Šnor as a public utility 🖥️⌨️ that mirrors 🪞 popular primarily Czech 🇨🇿 and Slovak 🇸🇰 X/Twitter 🐦 accounts, bringing to Mastodon 🐘 otherwise missing news 📰, sports ⚽️🏒🏎️, tech info 📱⌚️💻📡, entertainment 🎞️🎶🎭, and sometimes humor 🤣🤪.

**🌉 BlueSky Bridge**: Since September 2025, most bots are also available on BlueSky via [Brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy/), expanding the reach of Czech content across federated platforms.

## About

The Czech Mastodon community is relatively small and often overlooked by newspaper publishers and other information sources. **Zpravobot.news** was created to bridge this gap by providing Czech Mastodon users with timely access to news and information from various platforms.

The project is run by [Daniel Šnor](https://zpravobot.news) and operates as a public utility, mirroring content from popular Czech sources across multiple platforms including Twitter/X, RSS feeds, BlueSky, and YouTube.

### Multi-Platform Availability

Since **September 2025**, the majority of Zpravobot bots have been bridged to **BlueSky** using [Brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy/), a service that connects Mastodon accounts with the BlueSky network. This means Czech content is now accessible to both Mastodon and BlueSky users, significantly expanding the reach of news and information across the fediverse and AT Protocol networks.

## The Mission

This open-source project focuses on developing and maintaining IFTTT applet filter scripts that automate content aggregation and posting to Mastodon. The goal is to create a unified, efficient system for content mirroring that serves the Czech Mastodon community.

### Supported Platforms

**Content Sources:**
- ✅ **BlueSky** - Social media posts
- ✅ **RSS** - Various news feeds and blogs
- ✅ **Twitter/X** - Tweets and threads
- ✅ **YouTube** - Video updates from subscriptions
- ❌ **Nitter** - Discontinued (service shutdown in February 2024)

**Distribution Networks:**
- 🐘 **Mastodon** - Primary platform via Zpravobot.news instance
- 🦋 **BlueSky** - Available since September 2025 via Brid.gy federation

## Technical Architecture

The solution uses a standard Mastodon server as the frontend, combined with IFTTT (If This Then That) as the backend automation layer. This approach was inspired by the **Press.coop** server but adapted to use IFTTT's infrastructure instead of custom backend code.

### Key Components

1. **Mastodon Server** - Standard installation hosting bot accounts
2. **IFTTT Applets** - Individual bots that monitor various sources
3. **Filter Scripts** - PRO+ subscription feature that processes and formats content
4. **Unified Output** - Consistent formatting across all content sources

### Why Multiple Scripts?

Due to IFTTT limitations, different connectors (YouTube, RSS, Twitter) cannot be mixed in a single applet. However, the core filtering logic should remain consistent. This led to a modular architecture where filter scripts are composed of three parts:

1. **Settings** - Source-specific configuration
2. **Connector** - Platform-specific data handling
3. **Universal Filter** - Common processing logic

For example, a BlueSky bot would use: BlueSky settings + RSS connector + universal filter script.
